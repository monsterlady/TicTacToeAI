>   Implements A Simple AI in Tic-tac-toe game using MiniMax algorithm.

## What is this Project?

It is a simple implementation of strategy game AI using MiniMax Algorithm in Unity.
The project is based on the two tutorials from youtube (link below) and AI classes slides and plus part is the simpleAI is integrated
So far the player would always be the first, might add feature that choose who would be the first in the future, but it doesn't really matter in this case as player can not beat this AI.
